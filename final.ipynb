    "# Amazon Recomendation Ranking\n",
    "In this study, we will be using the amazon dataset to suggest items to purchase for users. Due to the size of the dataset, we will only use the All Beauty category to simplify our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is NOT a binary classification problem where we have to guess if a user will buy or not buy an item. Its a **ranking** problem, where we have to suggest a list of items in a order that best suits the interests of the user. To demostrate, suppose we have user who has bought $[burger, soda]$ and suppose we have the following items to recommend $\\{salad, fries, hotdog\\}$, how might you reorder these recommendations so that the most likely item to be purchased comes first? A reasonable model would probably suggest $[fries, hotdog, salad]$, where fries are the most likely thing to be purchased, followed by a hotdog, and then finally salad as the least likely recommended thing to be purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "The reason this task is significantly more difficult than classification is that there is no ground truth to evaluate against, meaning we can't use metrics like accuracy or MSE. Instead, because ranking is based on relevance (it may be better recommend salad first for user B instead of user A), its better to use relative ranking metrics like `Hit rate @ K` and `Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)` to evaluate our models. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `Hit rate @ K`: fraction of recommendations where the positive item is found within the top K positions\n",
    "$$\\text{Hit Rate @ K} = \\frac{\\text{Number of users with one hit (positive item) in top K}}{\\text{total number of users}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)`: average of the reciprocal of the rank of the positive item. Let $R$ be all sets of ordered recommened items.\n",
    "$$\\text{Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)} = \\frac{1}{|R|} \\sum_{r \\in R}^{R} \\frac{1}{\\text{Rank of positive item in set } r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get an estimate of the mean rank by computing\n",
    "$$\\text{mean rank} = \\frac{1}{MRR}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both hit rate and MRR have a range of $[0,1]$, where the higher the number, the better the results. For these metrics to work, we must generate a list of recommended items with a positive item in there. Then, we will order it using a model and evaluate it using these metrics. See the 'Data Processing' section for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validity\n",
    "We believe our model will have validity in its predictions for a number of reasons:\n",
    "1) Our temporal split (see Data Processing) mimics how our recommender system will work in real life: only using past data to predict future cases.\n",
    "2) The lenient nature of ranking means that cases where ranks are truly 'incorrect' are rare. Just because a negative item is ranked #1, doesn't mean that its a bad recommendation. Maybe user A decided to eat the lesser picked salad instead of the commonly chosen fries.\n",
    "3) Our custom models perform better than the baseline in both validation and testing evaluations."

    "What the follow code block does:\n",
